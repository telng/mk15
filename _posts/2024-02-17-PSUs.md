The MK15 will need three supply rails (gone are the days when just a red-hot 7805 would suffice) - 3.3V for I/O, 1.5V for the DDR3 bit and 1.2V for the core of the Spartan 6.

1A's more than sufficient for both of the lower rails, so we'll just use LDOs for them - the ubiquitous AMS1117 in this case.  I'd like 2A available on the 3.3V rail, 
which is most efficiently accomplished using a buck converter.  TI's Webench designed it for me:

And here's the schematic:

and the first cut of the layout.  It's kind of wild that the switch-mode bit occupies about the same amount of board space as the DC jack..
