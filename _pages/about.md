This is the story of the development of the MK15.  The MK15 is a board with an FPGA, some RAM, a 7-segment
display and 25 keys - designed to look a bit like the old Science of Cambridge Mk14, and to be used for 
playing with processor design and low-level coding.

The inspiration comes from (obviously) Clive Sinclair's classic, and from my daughter whose initials are
MK, who's 15 years old and who keeps asking me questions about CPU architecture from her Computer Science 
course.
